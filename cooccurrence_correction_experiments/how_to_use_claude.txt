1. Run generate_compound_prompts_and_claude_inputs.py
2. Take the claude-input file that it generates (ending in "_claude_inputs.txt") and give it as an attachment to the Claude website (Sonnet 3.5) with the following prompt:

"I generated prompts for me to probe CLIP on <DATASET>. Could you generate natural sentences that I could add based on the attached prompts? We should aim for broad coverage across the various categories and combinations present in the dataset. The sentences need not be fancy."


3. Take outputs, copy the generated compound-prompts file (ending in "_simple_single_and_compound_prompts_without_claude.txt"), and add the claude outputs to it manually. Rename the copy to end in "_compound_prompts.txt".
